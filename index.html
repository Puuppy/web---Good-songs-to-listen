  <h2>SONG</h2>
  <p>SONG is a musical composition intended to be vocally performed
     by the human voice. This is often done at distinct and fixed pitches
     (melodies) using patterns of sound and silence. Songs contain various
     forms, such as those including the repetition and variation of sections.
